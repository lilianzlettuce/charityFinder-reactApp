Veracity is a charity-searching web app that provides users with the most highly rated charities based on their chosen organization category along with allowing them to directly search up the accountability rating (a score out of 100) of any organization they have in mind.

The search by category feature only displays charities with a score of 90 or above, and 10 randomly selected orgs are displayed at a time. Clicking the same category multiple times will give you different charities.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, and it implements the Charity Navigator API. The free trial only lasts for a month, so it's likely this won't work anymore by the time anyone sees it :( Not much I can do about that though ¯(°_o)/¯
